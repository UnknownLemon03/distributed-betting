#  Distributed Betting 
Distributed Betting is a low-latency, microservices-based trading and betting platform that allows users to buy and sell stocks or bet on live matches with real-time updates. Built using high-performance gRPC, Kafka, and Saga pattern, this system is designed to ensure scalability, resilience, and event-driven orchestration across services.
The platform focuses on speed, consistency, and distributed fault tolerance, making it ideal for real-time financial or match-based prediction applications.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Betting & Trading
- Place **bets** or **buy/sell stocks** with live updates.
- Built for **concurrent, low-latency operations** using gRPC.

### üß© Microservices Architecture
- Independent services for wallet, user, betting, market, and more.
- Communicate via **Kafka** and **gRPC** for performance and resilience.

### üîÅ Saga Pattern
- Ensures **distributed transaction consistency**.
- Example flow:
  - Wallet deduction ‚Üí Bet placed ‚Üí Event update ‚Üí Rollback on failure

### üí∞ Wallet & Transactions
- Fully secure and isolated **wallet service**.
- Supports deposits, withdrawals.
  
### üßÆ Custom Order Book Engine (Go)
- Supports **limit orders**, **market orders**, and **order matching** logic.
- Blazing-fast custom order book built in Go, designed for high concurrency using goroutines with deadlock-safe matching logic.
- Uses **Go routines** for high concurrency and performance.
- Handles concurrency and fairness with high efficiency.

### ‚ö° Low-Latency Market Order Placement
- Orders are placed and matched within milliseconds using gRPC.
- Designed to simulate real-world exchange performance.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Auto Game Scheduling  
- Automatically schedules **matches** at regular intervals using Spring Boot Scheduled tasks.  
- Publishes MatchCreateEvent and MatchCompleteEvent to **Kafka** for downstream processing.
